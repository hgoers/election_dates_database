# election_dates_database

This repo contains the code I use to generate and update a comprehensive list of elections held globally. The data are pulled from https://www.electionguide.org/. 

## How to use:
1. Collect the unqiue URLs for each election using election_url_pull.
2. Collect data for each election using election_data_pull. 

## What you get:
1. A .txt file containing the unique URLs, with LDI. 
2. A .csv file containing the election data, with LDI.
