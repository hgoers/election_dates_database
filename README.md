# Comprehensive global election database

This repo contains the R code that I use to generate and update a comprehensive list of elections held globally. The data are pulled from https://www.electionguide.org/. 

## What you get:
1. A .rda file containing the database, with the date of the last pull. 
2. A .csv file containing the database, with the date of the last pull.
